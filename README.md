# Facebook Bulk Photo Upload

Facebook's Uploader is laggy and buggy, so you can use this Facebook Bulk Uploader to upload all your images in a directory using PHP.


Things you need to configure in the script (index.php):

- An Access Token (get it from https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
- Your user ID, group ID or the album ID where you want to upload the images (get it from http://findmyfbid.com)
- Path to your directory of images


Run in terminal using "php -q index.php" and watch it upload!
